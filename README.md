Final year reasearch project_Flood disaster management system

A tool which can be used to find impact of a
flood hazard on road network, the possible places for IDP
camps and the health risk of affected population due to water
borne diseases is designed and developed in this study. The tool
can be used immediately after a flood disaster with existing
demographic data and the current flood affected area data. It
identifies the roads blocked by a flood and then assists in
identifying alternative routes to reach resource centers such as
camps and hospitals avoiding the flood. The capacities and
facilities in hospitals and possible locations for temporary
camps are provided so that the needs of the victims can be
matched effectively. Further, it identifies the medicine needs
based on the affected population. The tool is develop as a plugin
for QGIS free and open source desktop GIS software.
